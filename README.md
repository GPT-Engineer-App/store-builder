# store-builder

Project Overview
I need a multitenant online store creation platform similar to Shopify. This platform should allow users to create their own online stores with just a few clicks. Each user should be able to customize their store, add products, and manage orders. The system should be scalable and secure, supporting multiple tenants with isolated data.

Key Features
User Registration and Authentication

Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
Implement email verification and password reset functionality.
Store Creation

Enable users to create and set up their online store with a unique subdomain.
Provide templates and themes for store customization.
Product Management

Allow users to add, edit, and delete products.
Include features for product categorization, pricing, and inventory management.
Order Management

Enable users to view, process, and manage orders.
Include features for order status tracking and notifications.
Shopping Cart and Checkout

Implement a shopping cart system for customers to add products.
Provide a secure checkout process with multiple payment gateway integrations (e.g., PayPal, Stripe).
Multitenancy Support

Ensure data isolation and security between different tenants.
Implement efficient database and resource management for scalability.
Admin Dashboard

Provide a dashboard for users to manage their store settings, products, and orders.
Include analytics and reporting features for store performance.
SEO and Marketing Tools

Implement basic SEO features (e.g., meta tags, sitemaps).
Provide tools for email marketing, discount codes, and promotions.
Responsive Design

Ensure the platform is fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
Technical Requirements
Frontend:

Use a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular).
Ensure responsive design using CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS).
Backend:

Use a scalable backend framework (e.g., Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails).
Implement RESTful APIs for frontend-backend communication.
Database:

Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) for data storage.
Ensure proper database schema design to support multitenancy.
Authentication:

Implement JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.
Use libraries like Passport.js or Django Rest Framework JWT.
Payment Integration:

Integrate with payment gateways like Stripe and PayPal.
Hosting and Deployment:

Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
Ensure the application is scalable and can handle high traffic.
Additional Instructions
Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
Follow best practices for security, including protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
Provide a detailed README file with instructions on how to set up, run, and deploy the project.
Include unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
Please generate the necessary code and configurations to build this project, including both frontend and backend components, database schema, and deployment scripts.
